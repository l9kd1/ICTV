class EmailDigester(object):  # TODO: Move pending emails storage to the database
    """
        An utility class that permits to send email to users while avoiding spams and generating automatically digests.
        Mails are sent using web.py sendmail function and thus SMTP configuration has to be set up in web.py.

        The details of its behavior is as follows: after created, all users are considered ready to receive email.
        When an email is added to be sent, the EmailDigester will schedule its sending with a slight delay.
        This will allow other emails that could quickly follow this one to be included and digested into a single email
        to the user.
        When an email is effectively sent to an user, this user will be marked as not ready to receive any emails before
        a certain time period. During that period, all emails added to be sent for this user will be digested. And after
        that period, they will be all sent in a single digested email.

        When adding an email, you have to provide an unique hash that represents this email. This prevents duplicated
        messages to be sent to the user.
